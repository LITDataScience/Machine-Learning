# Machine-Learning (Algorithms solved with simple solutions)

Find easy to learn solutions to various Machine Learning algorithms and concepts.
## Getting Started

You should have the basic understanding of all the different Machine Learning concepts.<br />
[Udemy](https://udemy.com) has rich set of courses available on Machine Learning.   

### Prerequisites

Python3, Pycharm or repl.it for testing your built code. Other than that, I've also used TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, etc.

### Installing Pycharm and Python 3

You can get Pycharm community version from [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).<br />
Command to install Python3 in Linux below:
 
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
```

### Installing TensorFlow and Keras

Refer the installation process of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) here.<br />
PIP to install CPU-version of TensorFlow:
 
```
sudo pip install tensorflow
```

PIP to install GPU-version of TensorFlow:
 
```
sudo pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

PIP to install [Keras](https://keras.io/):
 
```
sudo pip install keras
```

PIP to install [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html):
 
```
sudo python -m pip install -U pip
sudo python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```

PIP to install [NUMPY](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html):
 
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip  
sudo pip install numpy
```

PIP to install [PANDAS](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html):
 
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip  
sudo pip install pandas
```
